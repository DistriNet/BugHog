BugHog is a powerful framework designed specifically to address the challenging task of pinpointing the exact code revisions in which a particular browser bug was introduced or fixed.

This framework has been developed as part of the _"A Bug's Life: Analyzing the Lifecycle and Mitigation Process of Content Security Policy Bugs"_ paper to identify Content Security Policy bug lifecycles, published at [USENIX Security '23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/franken).
Since then, it has continued to evolve and has been exhibited at major cybersecurity conferences, including [Black Hat USA](https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/arsenal/schedule/index.html#bughog-38604).

## Getting started :rocket:

BugHog is compatible with UNIX systems running Docker, including WSL on Windows.
You will need at least 5 GB of disk space.

Follow these steps to get started:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DistriNet/BugHog
cd BugHog

# Pull our pre-built Docker images
./scripts/pull.sh

# Start the pulled images
./scripts/start.sh
```

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) to access the graphical user interface.
If BugHog is started on a remote server, substitute 'localhost' with the appropriate IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your Docker configuration, you might have to use `sudo ./scripts/[..]`.
>
> BugHog in default configuration will spin up its own MongoDB container, which persists data in the [/database](/database/) folder.
> Configuring BugHog to use your own MongoDB and other options are explained [here](https://github.com/DistriNet/BugHog/wiki/Configuration-options).

> [!TIP]
> Our [30-minute tutorial](https://github.com/DistriNet/BugHog/wiki/Tutorial) will guide you on how to use BugHog to trace a real bug's lifecycle!

To stop BugHog, simply run this in the project root:

```bash
./scripts/stop.sh
```


## Development :hammer_and_wrench:

Use the following commands to build the Docker images yourself, for instance after you made changes to the source code:

```bash
# Build BugHog images
./scripts/build.sh

# Run the freshly built images
./scripts/start.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> For reference, building takes about 4 minutes on a machine with 8 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM.


### Debugging

The most convenient debugging approach is to launch an interactive Node environment.
The UI can be visited at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

```bash
./scripts/node_dev.sh
```

For debugging the core application, consider using the VS Code dev container.
You can utilize the configuration in [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) for this.
